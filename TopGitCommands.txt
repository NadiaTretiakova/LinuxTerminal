1. Git clone
Git clone is a command for downloading existing source code from a remote repository (like Github, for example). In other words, Git clone basically makes an identical copy of the latest version of a project in a repository and saves it to your computer.
Example:
git clone <https://name-of-the-repository-link>

======================================================================

2. Git branch
Branches are highly important in the git world. By using branches, several developers are able to work in parallel on the same project simultaneously. We can use the git branch command for creating, listing and deleting branches.

Creating a new branch:
git branch <branch-name>

This command will create a branch locally. To push the new branch into the remote repository, you need to use the following command:
git push -u <remote> <branch-name>

Viewing branches:
git branch or git branch --list

Deleting a branch:
git branch -d <branch-name>

=====================================================================

3. Git checkout
This is also one of the most used Git commands. To work in a branch, first you need to switch to it. We use git checkout mostly for switching from one branch to another. We can also use it for checking out files and commits.
git checkout <name-of-your-branch>

There are some steps you need to follow for successfully switching between branches:

The changes in your current branch must be committed or stashed before you switch
The branch you want to check out should exist in your local
There is also a shortcut command that allows you to create and switch to a branch at the same time:
git checkout -b <name-of-your-branch>

This command creates a new branch in your local (-b stands for branch) and checks the branch out to new right after it has been created.

=====================================================================

4. Git status
The Git status command gives us all the necessary information about the current branch. 
git status

We can gather information like:

Whether the current branch is up to date
Whether there is anything to commit, push or pull
Whether there are files staged, unstaged or untracked
Whether there are files created, modified or deleted

======================================================================

5. Git add
When we create, modify or delete a file, these changes will happen in our local and won't be included in the next commit (unless we change the configurations).

We need to use the git add command to include the changes of a file(s) into our next commit. 

To add a single file:
git add <file>

To add everything at once:
git add -A

The git add command doesn't change the repository and the changes are not saved until we use git commit.

6. Git commit
This is maybe the most-used command of Git. Once we reach a certain point in development, we want to save our changes (maybe after a specific task or issue).

Git commit is like setting a checkpoint in the development process which you can go back to later if needed.

We also need to write a short message to explain what we have developed or changed in the source code.

git commit -m "commit message"
Important: Git commit saves your changes only locally.

7. Git push
After committing your changes, the next thing you want to do is send your changes to the remote server. Git push uploads your commits to the remote repository.

git push <remote> <branch-name>
However, if your branch is newly created, then you also need to upload the branch with the following command:

git push --set-upstream <remote> <name-of-your-branch>
or

git push -u origin <branch_name>
Important: Git push only uploads changes that are committed.
